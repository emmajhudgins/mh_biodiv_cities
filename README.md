## Code

1. Analysis - this folder includes all scripts used to clean the eBird data and covariates. This cleaned data was used at the Carleton Statistics Canada RDC to model the link between biodiversity and Canadian mental health data in cities.
2. Plotting - vetted results (cleaned of any privacy-restricted information) were extracted from the RDC analysis and used in these plotting scripts


*Note - due to large file sizes, the `analysis/data` folder and two of the `analysis/output` files have been zipped and attached to the release.*
