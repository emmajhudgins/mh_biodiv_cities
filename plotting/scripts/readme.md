Emma email: I hope my odds ratio conversion helps to interpret the model output on the plots but  I can add an example calculation somewhere in there if you think itâ€™d be useful? For example, an odds ratio of 1.1 for married vs unmarried in the mental health model would mean married people are 10% more likely to have poor mental health, whereas 0.9 would mean theyre 10% less likely.

Goals: 

The predicted proportion of the sample with poor mental health by Shannon diversity of birds and tree richness for models 1,3 and 4. Is that possible? My dream graph is 6 panels like the doodle I have attached. 

Can we make the biodiversity variables all the same for all data, low marg, and high marg data stratification? Right now, for all data models we use modeled bird species richness; low marg we use Chao-estimated bird Shannon diversity; and high marg we use modelled bird shannon diversity. In the mental health models we use all the same bird diversity index, which makes it easy to compare between data stratification. I would select the one which has the lowest AIC in model 1 with all data (modeled bird species richness?).
